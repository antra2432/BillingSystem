 ðŸš€ I developed a robust bill calculation system for a restaurant using core Java and leveraged the ArrayList collection framework for efficient data management. This project demonstrates my proficiency in Java programming and my ability to implement complex algorithms. The system accurately calculates the bill, taking into account the items ordered, their prices, and any applicable taxes such as SGST and CGST. At the end, it generates a detailed bill, providing a comprehensive breakdown of the order and the final amount due. Proud to have created a solution that streamlines the billing process and enhances customer satisfaction.
